## NER Experiments with Indolem

The code is based on HuggingFace's transformers named entity detection example and consistent with transformers 2.9.0.

To run the 5-fold cross-validation experiments, use the `run_ner.sh` file.



The BiLSTM-CRF baseline is based on https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/tf_ner.
